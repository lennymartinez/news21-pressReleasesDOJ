# Data Diary: DoJ press releases

Going through the press releases scraped from the DoJ's website. 

## June 5, 2018

I forgot everything I had done before to get the data I'm looking at, so I'm going to start this diary there. 

Sarah and I initially talked about scraping DoJ press releases related to hate crimes (found [here](https://www.justice.gov/crt/press-releases))

I'll add a part in on how I did the initial scraping when I get a chance, but there are scripts and folders and lists. Jk. I'll do that now because I don't remeber what I did 



### Q0: Which press releases are related to hate crimes?
